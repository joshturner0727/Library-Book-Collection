# Library-Book-Collection
This is my final project for my CIS 319 class. It is a Java program that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a small library database. It is a small example of something that could become a
much bigger program in the future. I learned a lot during this project and some of the problems were difficult to overcome at first. I especially had trouble with getting my add and update functions 
to work correctly, but once I was able to the project really came together. This project satisfies all of the requirements laid out in the course project overview.
